## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-host process forest

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/hosts/{host_id}/tree` returning the process forest for that host. The response SHALL nest each process under its parent and SHALL attach the network connections and DNS queries that occurred during each process's lifetime. By default the response SHALL collapse repeated identical-path leaf siblings under the same parent into aggregated nodes, each carrying the group's count, its exited-versus-running split, its first and last fork times, and a capped sample of the underlying members, nested in the forest exactly where the collapsed siblings sat. The endpoint SHALL accept an optional `flatten` boolean query parameter; when set it returns the raw, un-aggregated forest with every node.

#### Scenario: An operator views a host's process tree

- **GIVEN** a logged-in operator and a known host with recorded activity
- **WHEN** the client calls `GET /api/hosts/{host_id}/tree`
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 200 and a JSON object containing the forest of root processes
- **AND** each process node carries its child processes and the network connections and DNS queries linked to it

#### Scenario: A time range is supplied

- **GIVEN** a logged-in operator
- **WHEN** the client calls `GET /api/hosts/{host_id}/tree` with optional `from` or `to` nanosecond bounds
- **THEN** the response is restricted to processes whose lifetime overlaps the specified window

#### Scenario: Repeated identical siblings collapse into an aggregated node

- **GIVEN** a logged-in operator and a host where a parent spawned many childless children of the same image path and binary identity
- **WHEN** the client calls `GET /api/hosts/{host_id}/tree` without `flatten`
- **THEN** those siblings appear as a single aggregated node carrying the group count, the exited-versus-running split, the first and last fork times, and a capped sample of the members

#### Scenario: An operator opts out of aggregation with flatten

- **GIVEN** a logged-in operator viewing a host whose tree contains aggregated groups
- **WHEN** the client calls `GET /api/hosts/{host_id}/tree` with the `flatten` parameter set
- **THEN** the response contains the raw forest with every sibling as its own node and no aggregated nodes
